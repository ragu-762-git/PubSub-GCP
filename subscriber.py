# callback: This is a function that gets called whenever a message is received.
# message.ack(): Acknowledges the message, telling Pub/Sub that it was successfully processed so that it doesnâ€™t get redelivered.




# subscribe(): Subscribes to the given subscription path and starts listening for messages, using the callback function to process them.
# streaming_pull_future: This holds the future result of the subscription, allowing you to manage it (like canceling it later).
# print(...): Prints a message indicating that the subscriber is listening for messages



# with subscriber:: Ensures that the subscriber is properly closed when done. This is good practice to release resources.
# streaming_pull_future.result(timeout=timeout): Starts the subscription and blocks the program from doing anything else until a timeout occurs (in this case, 5 seconds).
# except TimeoutError:: Catches a TimeoutError, which occurs when the specified timeout is reached.
# streaming_pull_future.cancel(): Cancels the subscription, stopping the message flow.
# streaming_pull_future.result(): Waits until the subscription is fully canceled before the program continues.
